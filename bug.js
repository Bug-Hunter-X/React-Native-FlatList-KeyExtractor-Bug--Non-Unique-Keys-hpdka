This bug occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and setting the keyExtractor prop to a function that doesn't return a unique key for each item. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as items not rendering correctly or the FlatList not scrolling properly.  Example:
```javascript
<FlatList
  data={[{id: 1, name: 'Item 1'}, {id: 2, name: 'Item 2'}, {id: 1, name: 'Item 3'}]}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  renderItem={({item}) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
/>
```
In this case, two items have the same id (1), causing the keyExtractor to return non-unique keys.
